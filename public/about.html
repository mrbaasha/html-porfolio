<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Bashi. I’ve been studying full stack web development for two years. As I approach graduation, I’m eager to kick-start my career as a web developer.</p>

<p>For the past two years, I’ve been designing websites for friends and developing porfolio project using open-source content management systems.</p>

<p>I’m ambitious and hard-working. I believe my skills can contribute positively to any team.</p>

<p>If I had to pick my best-designed website so far, it would be [movie ranking project and birthday invite project ].</p>
